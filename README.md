# SkyWatch
Sky Watch is a Python program that retrieves weather information for a user-specified location using the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it on a graphical user interface (GUI) built with the tkinter module. The program uses geopy and timezonefinder libraries to determine the user's location, and pytz to get the local time. The GUI contains a search box, a logo, and a box displaying the weather information, including temperature, weather condition, wind speed, humidity, pressure, and description. The program also displays the current local time for the user's location.
